To run the system first of all you have to open your terminal in this root and run: 

$ node .

The next step is go to the Client folder and run in another terminal:

$ ionic serve

If it doesn't work you will probably have to install the following:

-NodeJS

-Npm

-Cordova

-Ionic

-Loopback

If still doesn't work please contact to me.
Thank you.
